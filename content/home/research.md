<!-- ## Current Research Foci -->

A goal of dark matter phenomenology is to translate the results of experimental searches into numerical values of our theories of new physics.  My primary interest is to develop novel theories of dark matter that can push beyond the limits of our present phenomenological lamp post with unique experimental opportunities.
